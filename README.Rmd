# BHAIBYE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

**BHAIBYE** is a teaching package that ships a small, tidy dataset and a Shiny explorer for the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in Germany and the EU/EEA. The numbers are based on the published BHAI workflow (Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections) and let you:

- explore per-HAI totals with bubble and bar charts,

- compare Germany vs EU/EEA rates per N people,

- visualise DALYs by age and sex with an age pyramid,

- view 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for cases, deaths and DALYs.

The package is intentionally lightweight: itâ€™s meant for coursework, demos, and quick exploration.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BHAIBYE from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-ruby910113")
```

## Dataset Description

**Datasets**

This package includes two datasets shipped with BHAIBYE and used by the app:

`bhai_summary`: Germany annual totals with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI)

`bhai_rates`: per-100,000 rates (Germany & EU/EEA) with 95% UI

`bhai_cases_de`: simulated person-level microdata (Germany, German PPS)

`bhai_cases_eu`: simulated person-level microdata (EU/EEA, ECDC PPS)

Both datasets contain the HAI types: `HAP`, `UTI`, `BSI`, `SSI`, `CDI`.

## Shiny app

The package bundles a Shiny app (under inst/shiny/) to interactively explore the data. It provides:

- **Bubble plot (per HAI)**: cases vs deaths, bubble size = DALYs (with 95% UI in tooltips)

- **Bar plot (per HAI)**: choose metric (HAIs / Deaths / DALYs), with 95% UI error bars

- **Geo comparison**: Germany vs EU/EEA per-N rates (slider to change N), with 95% UI

- **Age pyramid**: visualises weighted DALYs by age and sex (from simulated microdata)

Launch it with:

```r
BHAIBYE::launch_app()
```
