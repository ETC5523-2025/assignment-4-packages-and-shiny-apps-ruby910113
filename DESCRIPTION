Description: Tools and datasets for teaching the burden of healthcare-associated
    infections (HAIs). Provides compact datasets for Germany and the EU/EEA:
    'bhai_summary' (annual totals with 95% uncertainty intervals) and
    'bhai_rates' (rates per 100,000 by infection type and outcome). Includes
    simulated person-level microdata ('bhai_cases_de', 'bhai_cases_eu') for
    age-sex analyses. Ships an interactive Shiny explorer launched via
    'launch_app()' with bubble, bar, age-pyramid, and per-capita comparison
    views. Helper functions support simple back-calculation and summaries
    ('implied_pop_de()', 'pyramid_df()', 'totals_for_sample()'). Methods
    reflect the BHAI workflow (prevalence-to-incidence conversion, scaling to
    population, and 'DALY = YLL + YLD' decomposition). Intended for coursework
    and demonstration.
