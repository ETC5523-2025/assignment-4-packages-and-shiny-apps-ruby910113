Description: A small, teaching-focused package for exploring the burden of
    healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). It ships two compact datasets
    (annual totals and rates per 100,000) and a Shiny app to visualise HAI
    cases, deaths and DALYs, and to compare Germany (German PPS) with the
    EU/EEA (ECDC PPS). Launch the interactive explorer with
    'launch_app()'.
